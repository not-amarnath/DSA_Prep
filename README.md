## Overview
- C++17+ solutions with emphasis on readability and correctness
- Multiple approaches where useful (brute force → optimized) with time/space complexity
- Categorized by topic for quick lookup
- Lightweight, self-contained files you can compile and run directly

## Repository Structure
The structure below reflects the current organization. If your repo adds new categories, extend this list accordingly.
- `array/` — arrays, two pointers, sliding window patterns
- `basics/` — language basics, STL, patterns, utility snippets
- `numbers/` — number theory, math utilities, bit manipulation
- `recursion/` — recursion and backtracking problems
- `.vscode/` — editor settings
- `.gitignore`
- `README.md`

Tip: Consider adding future categories such as `strings/`, `linked-list/`, `stacks-queues/`, `binary-search/`, `greedy/`, `heap/`, `tree-bst/`, `graph/`, `trie/`, `dynamic-programming/` as your repository grows.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
